Simple forum-like website that uses node.js, nginx and MongoDB. I created this to learn all the webdev stuff.

Run update.sh to install all programs & dependencies, start the server, and each time you change code in src/ directory.

Currently, the server should work with Arch Linux. In future, I will add support for FreeBSD and probably Debian-based distros.
